A comprehensive functional programming toolkit for Kubernetes development, providing functional wrappers for controller-runtime packages and additional utilities for composable, type-safe, and error-safe interactions with Kubernetes resources and controller patterns.

## Overview

FCR brings functional programming paradigms to Kubernetes development by leveraging monadic patterns (Either, IO, Reader) from [IBM/fp-go](https://github.com/IBM/fp-go). It provides both functional wrappers for controller-runtime packages and additional utilities designed specifically for functional programming patterns, enabling:

- **Composable Operations**: Chain complex Kubernetes operations and controller patterns together cleanly
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's type system with functional programming patterns
- **Error Safety**: Handle errors explicitly through Either types
- **Testability**: Pure functional operations are easier to test and reason about
- **Immutability**: Functional approach reduces side effects and improves reliability
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Functional wrappers for all controller-runtime packages plus additional utilities

## Features

- üéØ **Functional Client Operations**: Complete CRUD operations, status updates, and resource management with functional patterns
- üèóÔ∏è **Controller & Webhook Patterns**: Type-safe controllers, managers, reconcilers, event handlers, and webhooks (Comming soon)
- üîó **Composable Utilities**: Advanced flows, transformations, query builders, retry patterns, and validation pipelines (Comming soon)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safety & Testing**: Generic functions with compile-time checking and comprehensive test coverage

## Package Structure

FCR provides both functional wrappers (mirroring controller-runtime packages with an `f` prefix) and additional utilities designed for functional programming patterns. This structure avoids naming conflicts, allowing you to import both libraries simultaneously:

```go
import (
    // controller-runtime packages
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager"

    // FCR functional wrappers
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/fclient"
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/fcontroller"  // Coming soon
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/fmanager"     // Coming soon

    // FCR functional utilities
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/flow"         // Coming soon
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/transform"    // Coming soon
    "github.com/appthrust/fcr/pkg/validate"     // Coming soon
)
```
